When initializing Helpshift you must pass these three tokens.

If you use this api to initialize helpshift support, in-app notifications will be enabled by default.
In-app notifications are banner like notifications shown by the Helpshift SDK to alert the user of any updates to the reported issues.
If you want to disable the in-app notifications please refer to the installForAppID:domainName:apiKey:withOptions: api
